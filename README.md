# VALA RL 25

Welcome to VALA RL 25. In this repository, you will find the lecture slides [here](slides), and three notebooks:

- [Notebook 1](src/1_dqn.ipynb) implements the *Deep-Q Network* (DQN) algorithm.
- [Notebook 2](src/2_seed_impact.ipynb) investigates the impact of the random seed on the training of machine learning models.
- [Notebook 3](src/3_dqn_vs_ppo.ipynb) implements the *Deep Q-Network* (DQN) algorithm and the *Proximal Policy Optimization* (PPO) algorithm by leveraging a pre-built library.

The goal is to play around with these notebooks to get familiar with RL. Open each notebook using the links above.
